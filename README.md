# Block Stacking Game

Hey All! Welcome to my **Block Stacking Game**. I created this during my web developer certification at SAIT. It’s a simple yet engaging game that I developed to improve my skills in JavaScript.

**Certification:** Web Developer Certification at SAIT  
**Deployed Game:** [Block Stacking Game](https://hb-portfolio.github.io/portfolio-block-stacking-game/)

## Project Details

This project was developed as part of the **Web Developer Certification** program at SAIT. You can view the deployed game [here](https://hb-portfolio.github.io/portfolio-block-stacking-game/).

## Game Overview

Block Stacking Game is a game where the player stacks blocks on top of each other as accurately as possible. If a block is placed inaccurately, the overhanging part will be cut off, and the remaining block will become smaller. The game ends when a block is completely missed.

### Key Features

- **Canvas Rendering:** The game uses the HTML5 canvas element for rendering the game graphics.
- **Dynamic Difficulty:** The speed of the moving blocks increases as the player progresses.
- **Collision Detection:** Accurate collision detection ensures that blocks are cut correctly based on the player’s placement.

## Code Quality and Structure

All the files are uploaded to the repository. I encourage you to look at the code to see the quality and structure. The main game logic includes:

- **Block Creation and Animation:** Logic to create new blocks, animate their movement, and handle user interactions.
- **Collision Detection:** Logic to detect and handle collisions between blocks.
- **Game Over and Restart:** Logic to handle game over conditions and restart the game.

## How to Play

- Click, tap, or press the spacebar to place a block.
- Stack the blocks as accurately as possible.
- The game ends if a block is placed completely off the previous one.
- The speed of the blocks increases as you progress, adding to the challenge.

Feel free to explore the code and see how the game is implemented. If you have any questions or feedback, don't hesitate to reach out. 

Enjoy my game!
